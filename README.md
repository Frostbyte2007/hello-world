I'm so fucking bored


So I'm a music producer from New Zealand, but sometimes,
I like to mess around with things like code, animation,
music, and other cool stuff. I grew up in Kaitaia, Northland.
And my name is Asher Kelly Williams, and I actually got my
name from my friend in highschool. And that's my story.

Sincerely,

Asher.
